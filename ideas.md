cashier can just ignore the customers while on their phone, but usually
customers will interrupt the cashier when this happens after a while,
but you'll just be on your phone indefinitely because you don't want to
interact with them

first play through as you, with very limited options (un-pickable options
visible). Then have the option of playing as any one of the other customers or
employees
But the goal shouldn't be for you to learn other people's behavious. They should
adapt to you, not the other way around.
So when playing as the other characters, maybe a goal could be to make
them leave you alone.
But the game should still allow for interactivities that don't aim
for this.


if you try to take an item while already taking some item, you will
forget the first one and won't be able to retake it. Maybe you can get
distracted by music or other sounds



People can get angry if there are not enough groceries stocked. Usually
groceries will be restocked by the store personnel, but not if they give
up working at the store due to a bad working environment. If you can aid
in causing a bad working environment without being thrown out, you can
thereby indirectly cause the shoppers to get angry. Maybe you can blame
other shoppers for your chaos.
