# Miscellaneous

cashier can just ignore the customers while on their phone, but usually
customers will interrupt the cashier when this happens after a while,
but you'll just be on your phone indefinitely because you don't want to
interact with them

first play through as you, with very limited options (un-pickable options
visible). Then have the option of playing as any one of the other customers or
employees
But the goal shouldn't be for you to learn other people's behavious. They should
adapt to you, not the other way around.
So when playing as the other characters, maybe a goal could be to make
them leave you alone.
But the game should still allow for interactivities that don't aim
for this.


if you try to take an item while already taking some item, you will
forget the first one and won't be able to retake it. Maybe you can get
distracted by music or other sounds



People can get angry if there are not enough groceries stocked. Usually
groceries will be restocked by the store personnel, but not if they give
up working at the store due to a bad working environment. If you can aid
in causing a bad working environment without being thrown out, you can
thereby indirectly cause the shoppers to get angry. Maybe you can blame
other shoppers for your chaos.


# Flavour text

This can top off the simulation the first time something is encountered.
There are no rules in flavour text, and as such there's also a risk that
it will be wrong and become out of date wrt. the underlying simulation.
But if constrained enough, maybe it's a good enough compromise.


# Testing

A test of the system could be to write down a series of actions that you
expect the system to accept, and then also provide a world state
inspection function that can verify that at least a subset of the world
state is as expected.


# Ideas for interaction chains

Each of these should preferably be without dialogue and instead focus on
actions that can be encoded in a rule-based system in some kind of
meaningful way.

They had really been increasing the crampiness factor of these small
supermarkets over the recent years.  You're standing at the end of an
aisle, looking for the ketchup.  It's not here.  You make a very
decisive movement to enter the aisle, only for it to get broken off by an
opposing person moving in your direction.  This aisle only has room for
one person at a time.

You finally manage to walk along the narrow aisle corridor, and notice a
series of red colors to your left.

However, a person behind you coughs impatiently.  Is it the same person
as before?  If so, it seems like an unstructured way of exploring a
supermarket.  In any case, the purposeful coughing only grows the more
you stand still.

> keep investigating => other person will become angry with you
> does not want confrontation => move forward and loop around => no reaction from other person
